(** Type-safe UUIDs.
    Probably need to refactor this; UUIDs are used in two places:
    + to uniquely name things across the cluster
    + as secure session IDs

    There is the additional constraint that current Xen tools use 
    a particular format of UUID (the 16 byte variety generated by fresh ())

    	Also, cookies aren't UUIDs and should be put somewhere else.
